# iVolunteer User Guide

iVolunteer is your dedicated application for volunteer coordination, designed with **volunteer coordinators** in mind. If you're looking to enhance your volunteer coordination tasks, iVolunteer is the tool that empowers you to **manage volunteers and volunteering events efficiently**. iVolunteer streamlines the process for **swift and effective coordination**, by combining the efficiency of a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** with the advantages of a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**.

**Command Line Interface (CLI):** a text-based interface that is used to operate software and operating systems while allowing the user to respond to visual prompts by typing single commands into the interface and receiving a reply in the same way.

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** a form of user interface that allows users to interact with electronic devices through graphical icons and audio indicators such as primary notation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `vfind n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `vfind n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [s/SKILL]` can be used as `n/John Doe s/friendly` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[s/SKILL]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `s/friendly`, `s/friendly s/caring` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `vlist`, `elist`, `exit` and `vclear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.
