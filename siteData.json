For example, ecreate n/Cle@n beach r/cleaner sd/23/10/2023 2500 l/punggol] dsc/clean the beach] m/trash bag b/50.0, which has invalid inputs for each parameter, would require 7 tries to successfully execute.\nHence, to reduce the number of invalid user inputs, we plan to improve our error messages such that they show all invalid inputs from the user, as well as their valid formats.\nThis way, users can correct their inputs all at once, reducing their frustration from entering many consecutive invalid commands.",
